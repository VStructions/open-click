# OpenClick

Open source mouse and keyboard control from a local network device

The [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) app creates an interface very similar to a laptop mousepad on Android (and IOS but I can't test it...) and the 
[Python](https://www.python.org/) script translates finger movements to mouse and keyboard input.

This application uses the [mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) and [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) python modules by [boppreh](https://github.com/boppreh) 
for mouse and keyboard emulation. Important note from both modules' documentation "*This program makes no attempt to hide itself, so don't use it for keyloggers.*".

Install the python modules with pip (or take a look at their repositories):
* pip install keyboard
* pip install mouse
